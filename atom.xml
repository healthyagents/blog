    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Model Overview</h1>

<p>EpiSimS is a large scale spatial agent based model for simulating the dynamics of contagious disease spread, based on the activity generator developed for <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/tmip/transims/">TRANSIMS</a>. The simulation is used for analyzing scenarios for responding to disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>For a general feel of the model scale, here are a few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Location: southern California</li>
<li>18.8 million individuals</li>
<li>2.3 million locations</li>
<li>6.3 million  households</li>
<li>938,000 southern California businesses, schools, restaurants, shops, hospitals, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>EpiSimS simulates the movements, activities, and social interactions of individuals in realistic synthetic populations. Disease progression is characterized by 14 states, which aare shown in the figure below:</p>

<p>Households are located to a specific city half-block, with multiple city blocks combining to form a census block group.</p>

<h1><img src="http://healthyagents.github.io//images/fig1a_blocks.jpg" width="600" alt="blocks" /></h1>

<p>Agent activities are assigned a specified start and stop time and a specified location. The activities undertaken by members of a synthetic household are drawn from the 60,000 activity surveys from actual households in the <a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/executive_summary.html">National Household Transportation Survey</a>.</p>

<p>The authors also explored scenarios such as the impact of disease on workforce absenteeism and reactive behavioral modifications.</p>

<p>The pseudocode of the model is as follows:</p>

<h1>Model results</h1>

<p>Even though, as with any model, they authors had to make simplifications, the results of the model are consistent with existing evidence provided by published survey studies.</p>

<p>The authors found that the average household size of a community is a powerful predictor (Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient of 0.9) of the local severity of an influenza pandemic. Population density, however was found to be a surprisingly poor predictor of simulated local pandemic severity.</p>

<p>Also, EpiSimS-computed impact of school closures for a 1918-like pandemic influenza. As the schools re-open, new infection waves appear for B and C:</p>

<p>The development of EpiSimS began at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2000 and is implemented in C++. The results have been published in several peer-reviewd journals.</p>
