    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Phenomenon of interest</h1>

<p>Given that hospitals in a region often share patients, this model attempts to model how an outbreak of MRSA in one hospital could affect other hospitals in the region.</p>

<p>An ABM approach would be suitable for this problem given that:</p>

<ul>
<li>studies of MRSA have focused mostly on individual or, at most, small groups of hospitals</li>
<li>most MRSA-colonized individuals are asymptomatic and colonization can persist for substantial durations</li>
<li>endemic or epidemic changes in MRSA levels in one hospital could potentially affect MRSA levels in other hospitals</li>
<li>regional evaluations are lacking</li>
</ul>


<h1>Model overview</h1>

<h2>Data</h2>

<ul>
<li>hospital-specific data from several sources

<ul>
<li>data on annual adult admissions and hospital length of stay (LOS) distributions came from 2006 patient-level hospitalization data from all OC hospitals</li>
<li>prior published work on how OC hospitals share patients</li>
<li>previously collected information about the number, size, volume, and average patient length of staywithin hospital intensive care units (ICUs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Structure</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Region modeled</strong>: Orange County (OC), California
29 acute care adult inpatient facilities are assigned agents(representing patient) who had a an either positive or negative MRSA infection status and who were moving among the general community and hospitals each simulated day.</li>
</ul>


<p>The general structure of the model is presented visually in Figure 1 below:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/3hospoverview.jpg" width="600" alt="Figure 1: Schematic flow of patients within the network and transmission" /></p>

<p>Each hospital consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>general wards (20 beds)</li>
<li>long-term acute care (LTAC) wards (10 beds)</li>
<li>ICUs (12 beds)</li>
</ul>


<p>Upon admission, a patient stayed in that ward for a certain LOS. They had a probability of entering either an ICU or a general ward, drawn the from table <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388111/table/T1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>After the assigned LOS lapsed, a patient in a general ward was either discharged back into the community or transferred to another hospital. After each assigned ICU LOS lapsed, ICU patients transferred to a general ward for the remainder of their assigned hospital stay. Discharged patients had a probability of being readmitted. Patients who tested positive for MRSA had a relative 30% increase in the probability of readmission to a hospital, which is consistent with previous findings.</p>

<p>Whether a readmitted patient went to the same or a different hospital was based on detailed interfacility patient-sharing data matrices.</p>

<h1>Model results</h1>

<p>The results of the model showed varying effects of outbreaks in one hospital on other hospitals in the Orange County, CA. These varying effects appeared to depend mainly on outbreak size and location.</p>

<p>Figure 2 below shows the effects of outbreak on other hospitals over time:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/3res.jpeg" width="600" alt="results" /></p>

<p>Increasing MRSA prevalence at a single hospital (from 5% to 15%) resulted in a 2.9% average increase in relative prevalence at all other hospitals (ranging from no effect to 46.4%).</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>This is one of the few papers that targets this sort of problems using agent-based modeling. From this model, we learned that for preventing and better managing MRSA outbreaks we should not limit only to the hospital in which the outbreak occured. We should also take into account that the hospitals are interconnected, and the infection can be transmitted from one hospital to another in non obvious ways as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>About the model</h1>

<p>This post highlights one of the obesity ABMs. This model is interesting as it addresses reducing racial disparities in obesity. The motivation behind building such a model comes from the fact that obesity is a complex health problem, as can be observed from <a href="http://www.shiftn.com/obesity/Full-Map.html">Foresight group’s systems map of obesity drivers</a>. Also, large disparities exist among people of different groups. There is a disparate patterning among socioeconomic status, neighborhood characteristics and health behaviors among other. It covers the main proximal determinants of obesity, such as: behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of dietary intake and physical activity.</p>

<p>The authors' approach in this paper was to model the potential effects of a social policy on the reduction in Black/White disparities in diet. The main hypotheses are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Policy effects and social network effects will have independent effects on the diet of both Blacks and Whites, but will also interact;</li>
<li>Targeting neighborhood school quality will reduce the Black/White disparities in diet because neighborhoods in our model with the poorest quality of schools also tended to have the greatest concentration of Black residents;</li>
<li>The effects of targeting neighborhood school quality will be self-sustaining, even after the policy is no longer in place, due to the propagation of diet behaviors via social network effects.</li>
</ul>


<p>The model starts oﬀ with a target distribution of ages, incomes and race for agents. Agents are born, go to school, get jobs and retire, can move from one neighborhood to another, have one child at age 25, and die. They exhibit health behaviors(smoking, diet, exercise) that produce health outcomes (BMI, cardiovascular disease and death).
Health behaviors dependent on neighborhood-level school quality, quality of food stores, and walkability and social network eﬀects. The figure below represents a snapshot of the model:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/2overview.png" width="600" alt="model overview" /></p>

<h4>Agents</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>Agent characteristics</em>: age, race, school attendance, educational attainment, and earning potential, and behaviors of friends;</li>
<li><em>Health behaviors</em>: diet, physical activity and smoking;</li>
<li><em>Outcome variables of interest</em>: Body Mass Index (BMI), cardiovascular health and mortality rate</li>
</ul>


<h4>Housing Units</h4>

<p>Each neighborhood has 25 housing units, organized in a 5 X 5 grid. Housing units can be either occupied(80% at the initial period) or unoccupied (the other 20 %).</p>

<h4>Households</h4>

<p>1280 households ﬁll 80% of the 1600 housing units. Each household consists of up to 4 agents.</p>

<h1>Model results</h1>

<p>The main model results are the following:
1. the quality of schools and social network influence had independent and interactive effects on diet behavior.
2. the Black/White disparity in diet behavior was considerably reduced under some conditions, but never completely eliminated.
3. the degree to which the disparity in diet behavior was reduced was a function of the type of social norm that was in place; the reduction was smallest when the type of social norm was healthy.</p>

<p>Percent of age group in school:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/2results1.png" width="600" alt="results healthy diet" /></p>

<p>Income distribution:</p>

<p>Smoking rate by age compared to NHIS data:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/2results3.png" width="600" alt="results 3" /></p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>Improving school quality can reduce, but not eliminate racial disparities in obesity related behavior, and the degree to which this is true depends partly on social network effects.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Model Overview</h1>

<p>EpiSimS is a large scale spatial agent based model for simulating the dynamics of contagious disease spread, based on the activity generator developed for <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/tmip/transims/">TRANSIMS</a>. The simulation is used for analyzing scenarios for responding to disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>For a general feel of the model scale, here are a few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Location: southern California</li>
<li>18.8 million individuals</li>
<li>2.3 million locations</li>
<li>6.3 million  households</li>
<li>938,000 southern California businesses, schools, restaurants, shops, hospitals, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>EpiSimS simulates the movements, activities, and social interactions of individuals in realistic synthetic populations. Disease progression is characterized by 14 states, which aare shown in the figure below:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/fig2_diseaseStages.jpg" width="600" alt="disease stages" /></p>

<p>Households are located to a specific city half-block, with multiple city blocks combining to form a census block group.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/fig1a_blocks.jpg" width="600" alt="blocks" /></p>

<p>Agent activities are assigned a specified start and stop time and a specified location. The activities undertaken by members of a synthetic household are drawn from the 60,000 activity surveys from actual households in the <a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/executive_summary.html">National Household Transportation Survey</a>.</p>

<p>The authors also explored scenarios such as the impact of disease on workforce absenteeism and reactive behavioral modifications.</p>

<p>The pseudocode of the model is as follows:</p>

<h1>Model results</h1>

<p>Even though, as with any model, they authors had to make simplifications, the results of the model are consistent with existing evidence provided by published survey studies.</p>

<p>The authors found that the average household size of a community is a powerful predictor (Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient of 0.9) of the local severity of an influenza pandemic. Population density, however was found to be a surprisingly poor predictor of simulated local pandemic severity.</p>

<p>Also, EpiSimS-computed impact of school closures for a 1918-like pandemic influenza. As the schools re-open, new infection waves appear for B and C:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/episims_1_lg.jpg" width="600" alt="disease stages" /></p>

<p>The development of EpiSimS began at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2000 and is implemented in C++. The results have been published in several peer-reviewd journals.</p>
