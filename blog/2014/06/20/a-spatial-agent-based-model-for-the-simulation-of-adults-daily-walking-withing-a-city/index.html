		<p>This agent based model simulates walking behaviors of people within a city. Agents are assigned properties such as a home location, age, socioeconomic status (SES), walking ability and attitude towards walking that evolve over time. The aim of the model is to better understand the determinants of walking so that more appropriate interventions to increase walking can be identified.</p>

<h4>General model characteristics</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tools used for model development</strong> : Java and Repast</li>
<li><strong>Time step:</strong> one day</li>
<li><strong>Space:</strong> 800 by 800 grid space, where each cell of size 10 m * 10 m. The city includes 200 groceries, 800 non-food shops, 1500 social places, 12000 workplaces and 60000 households</li>
<li>108000 agents  (48000 couples and 12000 single people)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Calibration</h4>

<p>Individuals can walk for three purposes: to work; for basic needs (such as food shopping, other shopping, and visits to social places); and for leisure.</p>

<p>The model was calibrated according to the parameters in the table below:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/calib-table.png" alt="calib-table" /></p>

<p>Spatially &ndash; the model represents a city of 64 squared meters, comparable in size to Ann Arbor, MI.</p>

<p>The model output was compared to selected data from the <a href="http://nhts.ornl.gov/">2001</a> National Household Travel Survey.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>The table below shows the average walking trips per day, and mean and median distances walked for model predictions and NHTS data used for model calibration:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/results-walking.png" alt="calib-table" /></p>

<p>The average trips per day for each purpose was computed as the product of the frequency and 0.35 because according to NHTS, Americans make slightly more than four travel trips per day of which 8.6% are walking trips.</p>

<p>The framework of the model is presented in the figure below:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/xx.png" alt="figure1" /></p>

<h4>What can we learn from this model?</h4>

<p>The authors explored a few scenarios showing us that walking amongst lowest SES is performed more to work and less for recreation, and they also had the lowest walking attitudes due to the lowest safety. They found that increasing safety is more effective at increasing walking amongst lower SES people as opposed to increasing walking attitude.</p>

<p>This model shows that ABM can be effective in helping to better understand the determinants of walking. How much people walk is determined by a wide range of factors, and ABM showed that many of these factors can be integrated to shed light into walking behavior and identify interventions to increase walking.</p>
